                <p>The domestic IT / ITES market has attained a significant size now but to continue with the same growth momentum for the next five years is not going to be an easy task. It will require the industry to create new user segments, identify new uses of ICT, define new relevance of ICT in the consumers' life and help develop the ecosystem required for that by designing innovative products and services.</p>
                <p>The domestic market has moved into a new phase where just affordability is not a concern, availability of the right products / services and applicability of IT has gained more prominence and a healthy orchestration of these 'three As' will help the market grow.</p>
