                <p>The media and entertainment industry is thriving on the current economic upswing and recorded revenues of INR 222 billion. This is up by 13 percent, compared to last year. Once again, television had another stellar year, expanding by 13 percent.</p>
                <p>The film industry also had the same growth rate of 13 percent. Powered by the three engines of additional delivery platforms, increasing content variety and favorable regulatory initiatives, the industry has transformed with new areas opening up, more players entering and traditional players being forced to adapt or perish. Propelled by innovation across its value chain and a series of enabling regulatory actions, the media and entertainment industry is expected to grow annually at almost 18 per cent to reach around INR 371 billion by 2010.</p>
